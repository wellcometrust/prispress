Our online stories challenge the ways people think and feel about health by connecting science, medicine, life and art.</p>
<p>We’re open to different approaches, but we tend to commission:</p>
<ul><li>Digital stories – unpacking the many layers of a particular topic through a set of six articles; each instalment is around 1,000 words.</li>
<li>Essays – narrative journalism, including opinion and personal experience pieces; usually about 750 words but can be longer for the right story.</li>
<li>Behind-the-scenes – giving insights into the process of researching, curating or creating a piece of work, up to 1,500 words.</li>
<li>Galleries – a set of images, either from our collection or commissioned, accompanied by a short narrative that gives context.</li>
</ul><p>We pay our writers, and everything on our website is published under a Creative Commons license. A pitch needs to include an outline of what the story will cover, why it is right for Wellcome Collection’s website, the format it will take, a proposed word count, when you could submit a first draft, and, if relevant, who you will interview.</p>
<p>The lead times on our content often varies (we may hold something back to coincide with a particular occasion), but a rough timeline from pitching to publication is around two to three months. Please only pitch if you can produce the proposed content within this time frame.</p>
<p>If you have a story idea you’d like to share, please send your pitch (no more than 350 words), along with examples of your writing, to <a href=""mailto:stories@wellcomecollection.org?subject=Pitch%20%7C%20wellcomecollection.org"">stories@wellcomecollection.org</a>. While we will give all pitches due consideration, we cannot reply to every email.</p>

<p>Welcome to our school partnership page. You’ll find information about the partnerships we have put in place with three London schools. We want to set up close working relationships with local schools so that we can consult on the way we develop our schools and youth activities and promote them to our 14 – 19 audience. Our selection criteria for partnership included the school’s location, socio-economic data and quality of application tasks. We will work with our schools this year to reflect on the success of these partnerships and will open for applications again in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>What is Wellcome Collection?</strong></p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is the free museum and library for the incurably curious. Inspired by the medical objects and curiosities collected by Henry Wellcome, it connects science, medicine, life and art. Through its exhibitions, live programming, and digital and publishing activity, it makes thought-provoking content which aims to challenge how we think and feel about health.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is part of Wellcome, a global charitable foundation that exists to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thrive. Both politically and financially independent, we support scientists and researchers, take on big problems, fuel imaginations and spark debate.</p>

"4061","/what-we-do/frequently-asked-questions-0","Frequently asked questions","<p><strong>Do I need any specific qualifications to apply to Ideas Hub?</strong><br /><br />
	No. Ideas Hub will work best with a diverse group of participants, so we are not looking for people to have a particular background or education level. We do, however, ask that you have a minimum of 2 years’ work or professional experience – this could be through full-time or part-time jobs, apprenticeships, internships, freelance work or anything equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>Does it cost anything to take part in Ideas Hub?</strong><br /><br />
	It is free to participate in Ideas Hub because we are keen to make it as accessible as possible. We will cover reasonable travel expenses involved in taking part and refreshments will also be provided throughout the week. If you are concerned about any costs that you might face because of taking part in Ideas Hub, let us know. We are happy to discuss ways we could help.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to participate for the full week?</strong><br /><br />
	Yes. It is important that all participants are able to commit to the full week of activities.</p>
<p><strong>How many places do you have available?</strong><br /><br />
	We are planning to recruit 20-25 people.</p>
<p><strong>How many applications are you expecting to receive?</strong><br /><br />
	We don’t know! This is the first time that we have run Ideas Hub.</p>
<p><strong>What is Wellcome? And what is Wellcome Collection?</strong><br /><br />
	Wellcome exists to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thrive. We’re a global charitable foundation, both politically and financially independent. We support scientists and researchers, take on big problems, fuel imaginations and spark debate.</p>
<p>As part of this, we run Wellcome Collection, a free museum and library exploring health, life and our place in the world. Through exhibitions, collections, live programming, digital, broadcast and publishing, Wellcome Collection creates opportunities for people to think deeply about the connections between science, medicine, life and art. Wellcome Collection makes thought-provoking content that encourages everyone to reflect on what it means to be human.</p>
<p><strong>Wellcome funds scientific research but I don’t know anything about science – can I still apply?</strong><br /><br />
	Yes. We are not specifically looking for people with a science background. We are keen to have a range of people involved in the week so that discussions can be as interesting and varied as possible.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve never been to Wellcome Collection – can I still apply?</strong><br /><br />
	Yes. We are not specifically looking for applications from people who are familiar with our museum or library. We are seeking a diversity of participants who are keen to explore the connections between science, medicine, life and art.</p>
<p><strong>Why does Wellcome Collection want to run a free programme like this?</strong><br /><br />
	We work as a charity, and our aim is to challenge the way people think and feel about health by connecting science, medicine, life and art. We think Ideas Hub will a great way to do this at the same time as giving everyone involved a great experience.</p>
<p><strong>What is Wellcome Collection’s Hub space?</strong><br /><br />
	Located on the 5th floor of Wellcome Collection, The Hub is usually home to the recipients of The Hub Award, a grant that supports a group of researchers and other creative minds to collaborate on a project over two years which explores the cultural and social contexts of health. In this space, residents can think creatively, collaborate openly and exchange ideas freely. Ideas Hub isn’t part of this – it’s taking place between research projects – but it fits in well with the principle of getting different types of people to work together.</p>

"4053","/what-we-do/research-network","Research Network","<p>At Wellcome, we want to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thrive. To do this, we need to be creative, collaborative and dynamic in our approach.</p>
<p>The Hub provides the opportunity for us to bring together unique voices, expertise and methodologies and be part of an experiment where new knowledge is created as a consequence of these collisions.</p>
<p>While this way of working sits within the more established field of interdisciplinary research, it is still very much taking shape. We believe developing this mode of enquiry could be fundamental to encouraging new ideas and novel approaches, and ultimately to improving health.</p>
<h4>The wider network</h4>
<p>As well as the learnings and insights gained from The Hub, we are also on the lookout for other models and practices, whether these are examples from museums, universities, research centres, art galleries, social enterprises or other public spaces in between. Activities we have undertaken so far that might inform how we work – and help us better understand and establish frameworks to support how we want to work in the future – include:</p>
<ul><li>The Hub Workshop: An international workshop that provided the opportunity to explore and reflect on approaches to collaborative, experimental and publicly situated research within museums, universities and public spaces.</li>
<li>The Hub Collaboration Workshop (in partnership with King’s College London): A gathering that investigated how to collaborate across disciplines to create engaging projects exploring health.</li>
<li>The Helen Hamlyn Research Associate (based in The Hub): This research associate will support The Hub as it looks to enhance how it engages and co-creates with neurodiverse audiences, focusing on collaboration, research and public engagement.</li>
<li>Ideas Hub: A week-long programme of activities and workshops that provides a mixed cohort with a platform to experiment with ideas, challenge their practices and connect with a diverse group of individuals.</li>

<p>The strongest answers were those that directly responded to the questions we asked and that tackled all aspects of each question. For example, in question three we wanted applicants to tell us about a specific experience, what they learnt from it and why it made them a strong applicant, rather than focussing on one of these areas or responding to the question indirectly.</p>
<p>Longer answers generally scored higher as they were often fuller and more developed.</p>

"4039","/what-we-do/safeguarding-children-and-vulnerable-adults-policy","Safeguarding children and vulnerable adults policy","<p><strong>1. Background</strong></p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is a free museum and library exploring health, life and humanity’s place in the world. Through exhibitions, collections, live programming, digital, broadcast and publishing, Wellcome Collection creates opportunities for people to think deeply about the connections between science, medicine, life and art.</p>
<p>We, the Wellcome Trust, operate Wellcome Collection and are responsible for this policy.</p>
<p>This policy relates to the Wellcome Collection spaces which are freely accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>Children and vulnerable adults visit Wellcome Collection to see exhibitions, to attend events, school study days or youth projects, or to use the bookshop, café and restaurant. Our exhibition and event content is aimed at visitors over the age of 14, but children under the age of 14 are welcome to visit the building if they are accompanied by a supervising adult.</p>
<p>Wellcome Library is open to readers with an interest in the history and understanding of medicine and related subjects. Readers are generally 18+, with the exception of 16-to-17-year-olds referred by a tutor; under-16s are only allowed entry with an accompanying adult.  </p>
<p>We recognise that we have a responsibility to provide a safe environment for children and vulnerable adults who visit Wellcome Collection. This document outlines the ways in which we aim to achieve this. The measures reflect our position as a public venue that welcomes children and vulnerable adults for one-off visits, usually accompanied by a parent/guardian, teacher or carer, but which does not expect to build any lasting relationship. In a limited number of cases (events and workshops run by our Youth Programme team), children may have a more sustained relationship with the venue. For all such events or workshops individual risk assessments are carried out.</p>
<p><strong>2. Organisational responsibility</strong></p>
<p>2.1 We will ensure that:</p>
<p>this policy is communicated to all Collection personnel (Wellcome Trust staff working in Wellcome Collection, service partners, contractors, members of the Hub initiative, Open Platform event organisers, and freelance staff);</p>
<p>all Collection personnel are made aware of their responsibility to adhere to this policy; and</p>
<p>all Collection personnel who work or may work with children or vulnerable adults are suitably and appropriately qualified and appropriate Disclosure and Barring Service checks have been carried out.</p>
<p>2.2 We will act upon any allegations of abuse against a child or a vulnerable adult. Collection personnel have a duty to report any suspicions or allegations of abuse to either the Youth Programme Manager or the Visitor Experience Manager, who will ensure that the allegations are recorded and reported to Camden Council’s Multi-agency Safeguarding Hub team at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>2.3 If a complaint is made against a member of Collection personnel, we will investigate the complaint and take appropriate action, which could include suspension and disciplinary proceedings. It may also be appropriate to inform the police and Camden’s Local Authority Designated Officer. We will inform the person who made the complaint of the action we have taken.</p>
<p><strong>3. Training</strong></p>
<p>3.1 All Collection personnel whose roles require them to interact closely with children or vulnerable adults are briefed regarding the contents of this policy and accompanying appendices and their obligations under it.</p>
<p>3.2 The Visitor Experience and Youth Programme staff, who are expected to have the most contact with children, receive annual training in relation to safeguarding issues and putting this policy into action. They will be further briefed about appropriate behaviour on a case-by-case basis at the outset of any project.</p>
<p><strong>4. Staff code of behaviour</strong></p>
<p>All Collection personnel are required to comply with the staff code of behaviour. A copy of this is available on request.</p>
<p><strong>5. Safeguarding: exhibition content</strong></p>
<p>5.1 There are two permanent exhibitions which contain human remains and this is clearly stated in signage outside both galleries to alert the public to the content. Any material in the temporary exhibitions that could be considered upsetting to children or vulnerable adults is dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Accompanying adults (including teachers) remain responsible for determining whether it is appropriate for the children or vulnerable adults in their charge to view the exhibition content.</p>
<p>5.2 A building-wide risk assessment is carried out annually. It identifies health and safety risks that could cause harm to any visitor. Controls are put in place to mitigate risks. In addition to this, individual risk assessments are carried out prior to any temporary exhibitions or changes in content, to identify and implement safeguards as appropriate.</p>
<p>5.3 Groups booking either on organised tours or as self-guided parties are issued with our gallery guidelines. These guidelines outline acceptable behaviour and clearly state that Wellcome Collection is aimed at a 14+ audience and that not all exhibitions or events may be deemed suitable for children or vulnerable adults. We welcome groups and schools to conduct pre-visits and we can help them to conduct their own assessment of whether the content is suitable for their group.</p>
<p><strong>6. Safeguarding: public events</strong></p>
<p>6.1 Entry to the majority of public events is by ticket only, which allows written warnings to be given on the ticket if the event content is unsuitable for children or vulnerable adults. If the content of an event is expected to contain violence, sexual references or swearing, the Events Manager, in consultation with the Visitor Experience management team, may impose restrictions on bookings. The nature of these restrictions would include a warning to parents/guardians when bookings are made or, very occasionally, an age restriction placed on an event. If an event is open to visitors without tickets, any unsuitable content will be clearly signalled/stated to visitors before they enter the event location.</p>
<p>6.2 Events specifically aimed at family groups, or at general audiences where children would be a key part of the audience, will be run by a suitably qualified, experienced and trained person who has been briefed in accordance with this policy and our other relevant policies.</p>
<p>6.3 The risk assessment process for any larger-scale public event will be overseen by the staff member managing the event. Risk assessments will identify risks to all visitors, including children and vulnerable adults, and the associated control measures to be put in place to prevent injury during the course of an event.</p>
<p><strong>7. Safeguarding: youth events</strong></p>
<p>7.1 Our youth events are designed for 14-to-19-year-olds. These include both on- and off-site activities, such as study days for schools, and youth and community projects. Risk assessments for all youth events are carried out by the Youth Programme event managers.</p>
<p>7.2 All youth events will be led by a suitably qualified, experienced and trained person who has been briefed in accordance with this policy and our other relevant policies. Disclosure and Barring Service checks will be required for Collection personnel who will have contact with children or vulnerable adults. The pastoral care and general wellbeing of young people will be covered either by the member of the Youth Programme team who will manage each event or by a responsible adult associated with the visiting young people, such as the school teacher or youth worker.</p>
<p>7.3 Extended projects with school, youth and community groups will be planned so that all participants register essential contact details with the Youth Programme team before the project commences. This includes, for any young person under the age of 16, a parent’s/guardian’s permission for participation and photographic consent. Registration forms will also ask for emergency contact details and nutritional and medical advice, and outline the specifics of the project so that full planning for the wellbeing and engagement of the participants can be ensured. Our position on intellectual property, explicit materials and data protection will also be outlined in this initial document. Anything not covered on registration forms will be included in the first introductory session (guidelines on behaviour, mutual respect and trust, fire evacuation etc.).</p>
<p>7.4 Young people participating in extended projects will also be given a takeaway handout which outlines our safeguarding approach written in clear and appropriate terms for them. This document will inform them about their rights and our disclosure procedures as well as who to speak to if assistance is required.</p>
<p><strong>8. Photography</strong></p>
<p>8.1 Occasionally we photograph events taking place in the building for the purpose of our own records or for publicity. We will only use a photograph where a child aged below 16 or a vulnerable adult features prominently if we gain consent from a parent/guardian or accompanying adult.</p>
<p>8.2 Our staff will endeavour, where reasonably possible, to ensure that other visitors to Wellcome Collection do not photograph children who are not in their party. Staff will report anyone acting suspiciously to the Youth Programme Manager or the Visitor Experience Manager on duty. Photography is currently permitted in the permanent collection and public spaces, but generally not in temporary exhibitions.</p>
<p><strong>9. Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>This policy will be reviewed as necessary as part of our ongoing risk assessment procedures. Training will be provided to Collection personnel as appropriate in accordance with best practice. </p>

"4003","/what-we-do/rawminds-summer-filmmaking-project-2017","RawMinds summer filmmaking project 2017","<p>Over the summer holidays we worked with 13 young people aged 14-19 on an exciting film-making project inspired by their own relationships with nature. The group was made from young people living in London who were selected following a short application process. The inspiration for our project was the exhibition ‘A museum of modern nature’.</p>
<p>Across the 12 days of the project, the group worked with Peter Kelly from Chocolate Films to create three short films. In the process, they developed their film-making skills in areas such as storyboarding, filming, sound recording and editing. At the centre of the project was a three-day trip that focused on wilderness survival skills, involving a wide variety of activities from firelighting to wilderness first aid. This experience formed the main content for the group’s final films, which they decided to create in three different styles, focusing on different aspects of their relationships with nature: beauty and freedom, technology and connection, and experiences and their value.</p>

	Interested in documentary-making? Want to go on a residential trip where you can gain wilderness survival (bushcraft) skills and experience the countryside first-hand? Apply now to work with expert filmmakers, bushcraft professionals and scientific researchers in our summer project.</p>
<p>This summer we’re inviting you to join the new RawMinds team and create a short film that explores your relationship with nature and wildlife. Across the project you will have the opportunity to develop your filmmaking skills in areas such as storyboarding, planning, filming and editing in workshops led by a professional filmmaker. They will work with you from start to finish, from generating initial ideas through to finalising your team’s film.</p>
<p>At the centre of the project is an exciting three-day residential trip to a site outside of London. As well as filming your experience, everyone will take part in a range of bushcraft activities, from camping and fire-lighting to learning about wild food and navigation, with lots more in between. There’ll also be the opportunity to interview leading scientific researchers as part of your exploration of our relationships with nature.</p>
<h2>Project dates</h2>
<p>The project will take place over 12 days between mid-July and the start of September 2017. Unless otherwise stated, each non-residential day will run from 10.30 to 16.00, with a break for lunch (provided).</p>
<p>A full list of project dates can be found if you download the application document below.</p>
<h2>How to get involved</h2>

"3871","/what-we-do/rawminds-public-speaking-and-presentation-project","RawMinds Public Speaking and Presentation Project","<p>At Wellcome Collection’s Youth Programme, we have <strong>six places </strong>available on our RawMinds Public Speaking and Presentation Project. We’re looking for young people in Year 10 or above, who know Wellcome Collection well, and who are confident public speakers or looking to build their presentation skills.</p>
<h2>What we need</h2>
<p>We have consulted with lots of young people to find out the best way to promote our events and projects to them. One of the strongest options is talking directly to them at school assemblies or to other youth gatherings. And we think the best advocates for our work are the young people who have been involved in activity here.</p>
<p>We want to give you some training - and a reward - if you’re happy to help us get the word out.</p>
<h2>What you’ll be doing</h2>
<p>This short, two-day project will train you in public-speaking skills and then provide planning activities so that you will have an engaging, polished presentation. We would like you to deliver three presentations in the summer term of this year, to help us recruit for our Saturday Studio events and RawMinds projects. At least one presentation will be at your own school, and others may be at neighbouring schools or youth organisation. You might also do one of your presentations at Wellcome, to show our colleagues what we’re up to.</p>
<p>You’ll need to enlist the support of a teacher at your school. They will have to approve your absence during the neighbouring school assembly, and help you organise the assembly at your school. The Youth Programmes team at Wellcome Collection will be very happy to liaise directly with this teacher, and we’ll provide you with an introductory letter to help with this.</p>
<p>Where possible, a member of our team will attend presentations for assistance.</p>
<h2>What you’ll get out of it</h2>
<p>We hope that the training will build your skills and confidence and be lots of fun. And, because the assemblies will help us recruit young people for our activities, we will thank you with the following rewards:</p>
<ul><li>£20 vouchers (Amazon or similar) general fee to cover planning time</li>
<li>£10 vouchers per assembly at your own school</li>
<li>£20 vouchers per assembly at a neighbouring school</li>
<li>£20 vouchers per presentation at a youth organisation</li>
<li>£6 Wellcome café vouchers per Wellcome presentation</li>
</ul><p>This means that your three presentations could earn you up to <strong>£70</strong>.</p>
<h2>Who we need</h2>
<p>To apply, you should:</p>
<ul><li>be in Year 10 or above</li>
<li>be available for the two training dates: 27 and 30 May 2017</li>
<li>have participated in previous RawMinds projects or attended at least two Saturday Studios at Wellcome Collection</li>
<li>be confident at public speaking or have a strong desire to build your public-speaking skills</li>
</ul><h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>Please fill in the application form below, which will ask you to commit to the two training dates, inform your supporting teacher and complete a short application task. As there are <strong>only six places</strong> available, you will need to demonstrate your enthusiasm and commitment to this project, and check the selection criteria to see if you are eligible to apply.</p>

<p>This collaboration was part of our programme for Bloomsbury Festival 2016, a yearly celebration of community and cultural cooperation. The theme of 2016’s festival was Language, and we decided to interpret this by exploring body language and looking at how our bodies can speak and be read.</p>
<p>The first session introduced the Youth Forum to the theme of body language through images from our archives and storytelling through creative writing, as well as generally encouraged the group to bond and work together. The day ended with a tour of Wellcome Collection’s permanent galleries. The second session introduced the group to three techniques of animation: rotoscoping, pixelation and using 3-D objects. The final session saw the young people finalise their storyboards and materials and execute their animations.</p>

We participate in large scale events such as Bloomsbury Festival, but also offer more bespoke experiences with one-off projects as well as our introductory programme, Wellcome Repackaged (see below).</p>
<p>We run projects which contribute to the exhibitions and events programmes at Wellcome Collection by working directly with groups of individuals with lived experience, responding creatively to our themes and sharing experiences and perspectives.</p>
<p>Though we're keen to explore potential partnership projects, we plan things well in advance.</p>
<h2>Wellcome Repackaged</h2>
<p>A two-session thematic, creative mini project that introduces Wellcome Collection and the community group to each other. Session one takes place at the community venue with object handling, creative hands-on activities and lots of interesting conversations. For session two, we invite the group to visit us at Wellcome Collection to see the galleries, be creative and have more conversations over tea and biscuits. These mini-projects are free for community groups.</p>

<p>The Youth Programme at Wellcome Collection worked in partnership with Voice Collective on this co-production project. Voice Collective, part of Mind in Camden, recruited and liaised with the young people involved in every workshop and also gave excellent voice hearing training to help Wellcome staff prepare for the workshops. Particular thanks are due to Tamsin Curno and Rachel Waddingham for their support and advice throughout the project.</p>
<p>Voice Collective is a London-wide project set up to support children and young people who hear voices, see visions or have other unusual sensory experiences. The team work in partnership with young people and youth organisations to improve the quality of information, advice and support available out there. To find out more, <a href=""http://www.voicecollective.co.uk/"">visit the Voice Collective website</a>, email <a href=""mailto:info@voicecollective.co.uk"">info@voicecollective.co.uk</a> or call 020 7911 0822 during office hours.</p>

<p>Wellcome Collection’s Youth Programme worked initially with Professor Charles Fernyhough, a psychologist who leads Hearing the Voice - a large interdisciplinary research study of voice hearing based at Durham University and funded by the Wellcome Trust. Charles advised on other voice hearing content in the ‘This is a Voice’ exhibition, helped plan the development of our artist-led co-production project, and also put us in touch with Voice Collective in Camden.</p>
<p>Voice hearing experiences are fairly common and are not in themselves necessarily a cause for concern. If you find that these experiences continue to cause significant distress or interfere with your relationships or daily activities, you should seek the advice of your GP or family doctor and seek other sources of sympathetic support. <a href=""http://hearingthevoice.org/frequently-asked-questions"">Find out more about hearing voices, including sources of support</a>.</p>

"3297","/visit-us/it-could-happen-anyone","It could happen to anyone","<p>This t-shirt and badge slogan is intended to intrigue and provoke conversations within the exhibition and beyond. The young people wanted to create something to support not just voice hearers but anyone who experiences stigma, and to create an artwork that extends beyond the confines of the exhibition and into their daily lives and those of others.</p>
<p>The conversations provoked can be considered as performative art interventions, in which the slogan wearer can direct their conversation according to their personal interests and agenda - or they might want to talk about the back story of the badge, which is the whole creative project. These conversations can be as playful or serious as the wearer likes.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the type of interaction that could happen, as imagined by Nikki, the young voice hearer who came up with the slogan:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What could happen to anyone?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Anything! Discrimination, homelessness, abuse, mental illness, bullying, racism… or voice hearing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The young people designed the badges and T-shirts themselves, supported by artist Hannah Hull and graphic designer Robert Sollis. 500 badges and 50 T-shirts have been made and distributed by the young voice hearers, Hannah Hull, Wellcome Collection’s Youth Programme and Voice Collective.</p>

<p>Running alongside our '<a href=""/exhibitions/states-mind-tracing-edges-consciousness"">States of Mind</a>' exhibition, this project was a way to record and share people’s stories of what happens when they're asleep. We collected the stories and the best ones were sewn into a quilt by our visitors. You can get a sense of the process in the gallery below. We have also kept a record of the stories for our archive.</p>
<p>Once completed and photographed, the quilt was donated to <a href=""http://www.mungos.org/"">St Mungo's</a>. The digital version of the quilt acts as both a legacy of this project, as well as a way for people to explore the beautiful contributions our visitors have made whilst getting a sense of the range of sleep experiences we gathered.  </p>

It features dazzling antiquities and modern vernacular art in an aesthetically seductive, intellectually rich mix of art, science, history and the ordinary made extraordinary.</p>
<p>The exhibition is open from 12 January to 28 March 2016 at the <a href=""http://csmvs.in/"">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya</a> (CSMVS), Mumbai.</p>

<p>The shop and youth programme at Wellcome Collection is delighted to have launched a new, exclusive range of products developed and designed by a team of young people who participated in <a href=""/rawminds"">RawMinds</a>.</p>
<p>Made up from a talented group of young people, aged 14-19, from all across London, RawMinds takes inspiration from Wellcome Collection’s treasure trove of objects and artworks that explore health and the human condition.</p>
<p>For this project, RawMinds worked with a range of professionals from the worlds of retail, product design and graphic design in order to develop their ideas and skills. It culminated in a ‘Dragon’s Den’ style presentation of storyboards and prototypes to a panel made up from Wellcome Collection’s retail, youth and commercial teams, with the selected design ideas taken forward to production. The short film above shows the energy behind this inspirational collaboration.</p>
<p>The products range from travel-card holders to stackable cups, t-shirts and jewellery and were launched in store on 21 July. Profits from shop sales go towards supporting the wider work of Wellcome, including future youth programme projects.</p>
<p>Other RawMinds projects have included curating exhibitions and developing a series of podcasts called Raw Emotion.</p>

"3009","/what-we-do/tools-trade","Tools of the Trade","<p>Tools of the Trade, by Stuart Haygarth, is a series of six light installations created from a selection of plastic and glass laboratory equipment commonly used in scientific research and experiments.</p>
<p>The items in this series were chosen for their aesthetic quality, the form taking prominence over their purpose. Using glassware for its sensuality and plastic items for their impact when used en masse to form molecular-like structures, the work proposes new perspectives on these functional, scientific objects.</p>
<p>Elevating the commonplace or discarded object is a central tenet of Haygarth’s work. His exquisite designs and installations employ the flotsam and jetsam of quotidian life. “My work revolves around everyday objects, collected in large quantities, categorised and presented in such a way that they are given new meaning,” said Haygarth. “It is about banal and overlooked objects gaining new significance.”</p>
<p>Come and see Tools of the Trade, on display in the windows of the Wellcome Trust, just next door to Wellcome Collection.</p>

<p>In India you see colourful signboards everywhere. Watch Chaitanya Modak’s film about what happened when some signboard painters tried their hand at the classic art genre of sitting portraits. The film followed an exhibition, Healers of Dharavi, held in Mumbai in February, 2015.  Dharavi is variously said to be the largest slum in India, Asia or even the world. The exhibition featured portraits of local healers who offer an astounding range of formal and informal treatments. You don’t need to have seen the exhibition to appreciate this heartwarming film. It offers a unique insight into how people live, work and struggle to stay well in the most challenging circumstances.</p>
<p>Healers of Dharavi was part of Wellcome Collection’s <a href=""/medicinecorner"">Medicine Corner</a> programme in India.</p>

<p>The story of electricity is the story of life itself. From the structure of the atom to the functioning of our brains, this invisible yet vital force is intrinsic to human life. For centuries electricity has captivated inventors, scientists and artists alike, and in the modern era it has transformed our world.</p>
<p>From the first breaths of Frankenstein’s monster to the brutal simplicity of the execution chair, this exhibition contemplates the contradictory life-giving and death-dealing extremes generated by electricity, and traces the story of how humanity has striven to understand, unlock and gain control over this invisible yet all-encompassing force, which continues to mystify and amaze.</p>
<p>Three celebrated artists have been commissioned to create three new artworks for this exhibition: John Gerrard has taken inspiration for his commission from Luigi Galvani's famous experiments into bioelectricity; Bill Morrison explores historical footage from the Electricity Council archive to consider the movement and networks of electricity and its profound interconnectedness with our daily lives; and Camille Henrot considers our energy-dependent lifestyles, as well as the relationship between humans, technology and the environment.</p>
<p>'Electricity: The spark of life' is a collaboration between Wellcome Collection (London), the Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester) and Teylers Museum (Haarlem) and will be presented as a touring exhibition at each of these venues, which began at Wellcome Collection in spring 2017.</p>

<p>Using <a href=""/book-human-emotions""><em>The Book of Human Emotions</em></a> by Tiffany Watt-Smith as a starting point, the group identified emotions that intrigued them. They learnt radio-making skills with support from facilitator Grace Huber to create a suite of 4 short audio pieces which will are available below.</p>
<p>The audio pieces were made available in a ‘listening lounge’, where visitors were encouraged to spend some time relaxing, listening and sharing some of their own experiences.</p>

<p>In collaboration with videographer, Stephen Rudder, and marketing and communications freelancer, Josephine Finn, a vibrant group of 17 young people worked to rename Wellcome Collection’s ‘Young Creators’ programme, develop the RawMinds ‘brand’ and produce a promotional trailer.</p>
<p>The group prepared a creative brief and directed and produced the trailer which is now being used to encourage young people to explore Wellcome Collection and join the RawMinds project.</p>
<p>Over the February half term and subsequent weekends the group collected multimedia assets to give a flavour of Wellcome Collection as a venue and of their own personal experiences of exploring the collections. Using our state-of-the-art recording studio the group then edited the content to produce our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XvC1bWeuc"">fantastic new trailer</a>.</p>
<p>To come up with the name ‘RawMinds’ the group looked at names other museums used for their youth engagement work and agreed some key principles for our name. It had to cover the range of creative youth engagement projects as well as saying something about the age and aspirations of the group. It was agreed that ‘Raw’ signalled youth, freshness and potential and the ‘Minds’ element referenced the thought and process that goes into any collaborative work.</p>

<p>We are a group of teenagers (age 14 to 19) who meet at Wellcome Collection during school holidays and at weekends to experiment with ideas, get creative, learn new skills and meet new people.</p>
<p>So far we’ve curated an exhibition (<a href=""/exhibitions/human-emporium"">The Human Emporium</a>), produced the trailer above and a set of podcasts called <a href=""/rawemotion"">Raw Emotion</a>, and designed new merchandise for the Wellcome Shop.</p>
<p>By experimenting with art through science and science through art, who knows what we’ll create next?</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>All RawMinds activities are free to join and we have access to amazing facilities, including a state-of-the-art Youth Studio.</p>
<p>This summer, young people will be developing design concepts, drawings, scale models and prototypes for products using CNC technology (flat-pack/cut-out components).</p>
<p>A selection of the work generated during the project will go on display, alongside the ‘flat-pack’ medical clinic we’ll be using for inspiration.</p>
<p>Applications will open in early June, and workshops will take place in late July and August.</p>

<p>Medicine Corner is a programme of activity exploring India's rich plurality of cultures of medicine, healing and well-being, culminating in a major exhibition that opens in Mumbai in January 2016.  Through music, displays, video and live events across the country, incurably curious audiences in India will encounter an aesthetically seductive, intellectually rich mix of art, science and the extraordinary in everyday life.  The project will present medicine in India across time, regions and knowledge systems.</p>
<p>Medicine Corner will take in health practices with ancient roots and widespread, modern application, such as Ayurveda and Unani, and will also highlight India’s role as an engine of cutting-edge medicine and research today and in the past. The programme will explore medicine as an integral, pervasive feature of Indian life.</p>
<p>Medicine Corner is being developed by partners and communities in India and the outcomes of the project will inspire a future exhibition at Wellcome Collection in London. For a taste of what's been happening in India and what to look forward to in London, watch this short video filmed in Dharavi, Mumbai's largest informal settlement. It shows the extraordinary results of signboard painters trying their hand at sitting portraits.</p>

<p>Two of the songs inspired by this research were available to listen to in the <a href=""/exhibitions/institute-sexology"">Institute of Sexology</a> exhibition. Hear all the songs written and performed by the group below.</p>

<p>It’s the group’s response to some of the themes and personalities in the 'Institute of Sexology' exhibition, informed by their own experiences as young trans people. The aim was to create a lighted hearted response to some really complicated ideas, in a way that everyone can understand and enjoy.</p>
<p>The group worked with artist Jason Barker to create the artwork and interviewed Dr Jana Funke as part of their research. Each person designed their own Transvengers character who travels back in time to challenge key sexologists and their ideas – many of which continue to shape society’s thinking about sex and gender today.</p>
<p>The comic was on display in the <a href=""/exhibitions/institute-sexology"">Institute of Sexology exhibition</a>. You can view it online below.</p>

<p><strong>How will the works affect my visit?</strong></p>
<p>Building work began in August 2013 and major works are due to continue until spring 2015. Works may affect your visit until the project is complete. There may be some clutter and noise as we grow and some of our galleries will close temporarily.</p>
<p>The 'Medicine Man' gallery is currently closed.</p>
<p><strong>Is the venue fully accessible?</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to keeping up our high standards of accessibility throughout the development and in our new spaces. All our public spaces are fully accessible to visitors.</p>
<p><strong>What does your programme of exhibitions and events look like during the works?</strong></p>
<p>We are running a flexible programme of events and exhibitions during the development project. We are taking the opportunity to be experimental, running events and happenings off-site as well as in our own spaces.</p>

<p><strong>Is the Wellcome Library open?</strong></p>
<p>The Library will remain open while we make improvements within its spaces. More information about how this will be managed is available on the Library website and blog.</p>
<p><strong>Is the conference centre open?</strong></p>
<p>We are not taking bookings for the conference centre from July 2013 until early 2015.</p>
<p><strong>When will the development finish?</strong></p>
<p>We are due to finish the development in spring 2015.</p>
<p><strong>What will the finished venue look like?</strong></p>
<p>The finished venue will have 30 per cent more gallery space, including a major new thematic gallery, which will hold in-depth yearly exhibitions. We will double our capacity for public events and open up new spaces, such as the Library's iconic Reading Room, to the public.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the venue a dramatic new spiral staircase will link three floors of public space and galleries.</p>
<p><a href=""/wellcome-collection-is-growing/whats-changing"">Find out more about the development.</a></p>
<p><strong>Who's funding the development?</strong></p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is part of the <a href=""/what-we-do/wellcome-trust"">Wellcome Trust</a>, a global charitable foundation dedicated to achieving extraordinary improvements in human and animal health. The Trust's investment portfolio provides the income for all of our activities.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an entry charge for the new spaces?</strong></p>
<p>No, Wellcome Collection will remain the free destination for the incurably curious. All of our permanent exhibitions and temporary shows are, and will continue to be, free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>What will the new venue offer for schools or youth groups?</strong></p>
<p>We are creating a dedicated Youth Events Studio for 14-to-19-year-olds. This purpose-built workshop will be a space for young people to engage creatively with science and art. The Studio will offer both high-tech digital technology and low-tech modelling and making equipment, bringing them together to create a unique environment for participatory learning.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you expanding?</strong></p>
<p>The expansion is a response to the overwhelming demand that Wellcome Collection has experienced during its first five years. The venue was originally designed to accommodate 100 000 yearly visits; in 2012 we welcomed 490 000 people to our events and exhibitions.</p>

"1944","/what-we-do/young-people-respond-superhuman","Young people respond to Superhuman","<p>Wellcome Collection teamed up with Camden Summer University and local secondary schools to offer young people the opportunity to engage with the Superhuman exhibition in creative ways. Young people took part in several projects.</p>
<p>Camden Summer University, in partnership with local NHS speech and language therapists, delivered an inclusive animation project linked to the Superhuman exhibition. The group of seven young people produced ' Future Beings' which features animations and interviews showing their predictions for the future of human beings.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/whats-on/exhibitions/superhuman"">Superhuman</a></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Marvelous! Superhero graphic novel</strong></h2>
<p>The Superhuman exhibition has been the starting point for several Wellcome Collection Youth Programme projects, delivered in collaboration with Camden Summer University. Each course ran for a week in August and was hosted by Wellcome Collection.</p>
<p>Ever dreamed of having a super power, being part of the X men team or flying solo like Superman? This summer, local young people worked with artist Konstantina Kapanidou, using the Superhuman exhibition as inspiration in creating their very own graphic novel panel. During this Arts Award accredited course, students learnt how to develop characters and create a storyline, and developed story boarding, sketching and inking skills.</p>

<h2><strong>Family trail</strong></h2>
<p>Our newly developed family trail introduces visitors to 'Superhuman', your heroic guide who will take you through the exciting and thought-provoking objects in this exhibition. Drawing activities, role play and discussion will help your group think about some of the complex ideas behind human enhancement. The trail includes an insert for adults to help guide their families plus a fun mask-making activity to be done at home.</p>
<p>You can pick up a free trail by asking at the Information Point. We would appreciate it if you could fill in and hand back the feedback form on the reverse of the adult section.</p>
<p>The family trail was designed and created by a group of young people from local secondary schools working with curators, gallery staff, designers and illustrators.</p>
<p>Young people working on the project: Chandni Bhanderi, Nargis Choudhury, Misbah Khan, Maria Mahfooz, Iskren Peev, Darren Sooben, Sabiha Uddin and Devak Vyas.</p>
<h2><strong>Documentary film project</strong></h2>
<p>This summer, a group of local students worked with film maker Suzanne Cohen to develop an idea based on one of the themes in the exhibition. During this AQA accredited course, students used research, interviewing, presenting, writing and commentary skills, as well as helping with camera set-ups and sound recording. The completed film can be viewed below.</p>

<p><strong>Sir Henry Solomon Wellcome (1853-1936): Pharmacist, entrepreneur, philanthropist and collector.</strong></p>
<p>Henry Wellcome had an early interest in medicine and marketing. The first product he advertised was 'invisible ink' (just lemon juice, in fact). In 1880, he joined his college friend Silas Burroughs in setting up a pharmaceutical company, Burroughs Wellcome & Co. They were one of the first to introduce medicine in tablet form under the 1884 trademark 'Tabloid' previously medicines had been sold as powders or liquids.</p>
<p>When Burroughs died in 1895, the company flourished under Sir Henry's leadership. He went on to establish world-class medical research laboratories and amassed the world' s most impressive collections relating to medicine and health through the ages.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is now housed in the original Wellcome Building (built to Sir Henry's specifications in 1932), which is next door to the headquarters of the Wellcome Trust, his philanthropic legacy. His vision was to create a space to house his collections, where professionals could come to learn more about the development of medicine and medical science.</p>

"207","/what-we-do/youth-consultation","Youth consultation","<p>A group of young people recently joined us for two days of exploration and discussion to help us develop our ideas for a new exhibition exploring sex. On the first day we discussed where we get ideas about sex from - consciously and unconsciously, the language we use, and the underlying attitudes we have that influence the way we think, even if we' re not aware of them.</p>
<p>The second day was more focussed on some of the specifics of the exhibition, and we began by completing a giant +2000 year timeline as a way of visualising and exploring changes in behaviour, knowledge, culture and social attitudes towards sex. Curators working on the exhibition told the group about their research, and showed us some of the objects they' re hoping to include. Then it was then the turn of the young people to discuss and develop their ideas for exhibits, public events and youth projects - which they did with considerable thought and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Armed with these suggestions, we are carrying out more consultation sessions to further refine the ideas, and will then compile a long-list of potential activity to take forward before the exhibition opens in October 2014, and during the exhibition run until autumn 2015.</p>

Artist Daniel Wallis worked with three groups: <a href=""http://www.centre404.org.uk/"">Centre 404</a>, <a href=""http://www.stpancrascommunity.org/"">St Pancras Community Centre</a> and the Studio Art Group based at Becontree Psychotherapy Centre in Dagenham. Daniel went out to visit each group at their own 'venue' before and after their visit to Wellcome Collection so that their Souzou experience could be tailored to their specific interests and needs, and so they were meeting a familiar face when they stepped into an unfamiliar setting. <a href=""/articles/community-groups"">Watch a short film created by Daniel about project.</a></p>
<p>We were keen to continue our links with the <a href=""http://www.nhyouthcentre.org.uk/"">New Horizons Youth Centre</a>, and asked Elaine Duigenan to develop a series of workshops inspired by Souzou to run with the Women's Group at the Centre. These proved a cathartic and liberating experience for those who took part, gradually letting go of their fear of 'doing it wrong' and opening up to each other and Elaine about their lives and challenges whilst being creative together. See a selection of photographs showing the sessions and the work produced <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/wellcomecollection/sets/72157634480356538/"">via Flickr</a>. Read Elaine's blog posts about the project below.</p>
<p>Another of our major community projects came to its exciting climax at the <a href=""/events/midsummer-picnic-1""> Wellcome Collection Midsummer Picnic</a> on Saturday 22 June. This year's theme was gardening and growing, with several months of projects involving the <a href=""http://www.westeustontimebank.org.uk/"">West Euston Time Bank</a> homework club and holiday family activities programme. Over 50 volunteers from the community took part in the Picnic event, which transformed Cumberland Market into a giant garden for the c.500 people who attended.

"4","/what-we-do/hub","What is The Hub?","<p>Located at the top of Wellcome Collection, The Hub is a dynamic transdisciplinary research space where people from different backgrounds and with a range of expertise collaborate on projects exploring medicine, life and art. The central residents are the recipients of The Hub Award, a grant of £1 million spread over two years that brings together a team for cross-disciplinary work around a theme linked to Wellcome’s mission of improving health.</p>
<p>The Hub is also a focal point of research into transdisciplinary practice, exploring how new knowledge is formed and how different perspectives can produce new insights into what it is to be human. This is achieved through bringing together practitioners, holding workshops, developing collaborative projects, and engaging with people through <a href=""/what-we-do/ideas-hub"">Ideas Hub</a>, a week-long programme of activities and workshops.</p>
